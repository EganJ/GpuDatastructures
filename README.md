# Gpu Equality Saturation

## Egg 
Many of the design elements of our equality saturation tool come from Egg ([website](https://egraphs-good.github.io/) and [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434304)), including
deferred rebuilding and separate match-lhs and apply-rhs stages. 

## Herbie
Our test suite `bench/` and rule set `rules.txt` are derived from Herbie: [https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie](https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie)
